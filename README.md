## Building

The build requires [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
v3.0.3+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:

    export ANDROID_HOME=/home/donnfelker/tools/android-sdk

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

* Run `mvn clean package` from the `app` directory to build the APK only
* Run `mvn clean install` from the root directory to build the app and also run
  the integration tests, this requires a connected Android device or running
  emulator

You might find that your device doesn't let you install your build if you
already have the version from the Android Market installed.  This is standard
Android security as it it won't let you directly replace an app that's been
signed with a different key.  Manually uninstall DRUG from your device and
you will then be able to install your own built version.

## Acknowledgements

DRUG is a result of a template project I've developed over the years as well as
a combination of a lot of great work that the [GitHub Gaug.es](http://www.github.com/github/gauges-android)
app and [GitHub Android](http://www.github.com/github/android) app showcased. Some fo the
code in this project is based on the GitHub Gaug.es and GitHub Android app.

DRUG uses many great open-source libraries from the Android dev community:

* [ActionBarSherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock) for a
  consistent, great looking header across all Android platforms,
  [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator)
  for swiping between fragments and
  [NineOldAndroids](https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids) for 
  view animations - all from [Jake Wharton](http://jakewharton.com/).
* [RoboGuice](http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/) for dependency-injection.
* [Robotium](http://code.google.com/p/robotium/)
  for driving our app during integration tests.
* [android-maven-plugin](https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin)
  for automating our build and producing release-ready APKs.
* [http-request](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/http-request) for interacting with
  remote HTTP resources (API's in this case).
* [google-gson](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) for consuming JSON and hydrating
  POJO's for use in the app.
